Solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm mainly using this project as a means to learn Rust, having previously been exclusively a Pythonista.

Most solutions should be runnable by `cd`-ing into the directory for a specific day, and then running `python src/main.py` for the Python solution (if there is one), or `cargo run` for the Rust solution.
